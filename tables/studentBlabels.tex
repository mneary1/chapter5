\label{labelsB}
Letter & P1 & P2 & Description \\ 
\toprule
A & 24 & 0 & Constant not used \\
B & 19 & 0 & Extraneous conditional where one or more conditionals have no affect in execution  \\
C & 117 & 122 & Extraneous type cast \\
D & 23 & 0 & Extraneous line duplication \\
E & 86 & 26 & Unnecessary line because it is extra information that does not achieve the program's core functionality requirement \\
F & 3 & 0 & Self Assignment \\
G & 453 & 44 & Extraneous syntax \\
H & 1 & 0 & Unnecessary return \\
I & 159 & 1 & No conditional required or should be default case (i.e. elif is not required if it is the base case)  \\
J & 1 & 0 & This line assumes that water is frozen if the temperature is less than K\_BOIL, which is not true. Water is frozen if below 273 \\
L & 3 & 20 & This operation should not be required \\
M & 6 & 18 & Unnecessary declaration  \\
N & 5 & 0 & Unnecessary operation exit() because using elif will ignore following cases if a previous if statement is true \\
O & 6 & 0 & This value is always overwritten in the following control flow, and is therefore always defined when it is actually used \\
P & 0 & 1 & Range defaults from 0 to n and the 0 is not required \\
Q & 0 & 13 & Unnecessary for loop \\
R & 0 & 2 & Counter not used \\
S & 0 & 11 & The default step of range is 1 \\
T & 0 & 108 & The default start of range is 0 \\
U & 0 & 4 & This function call / declaration does not accomplish anything \\
